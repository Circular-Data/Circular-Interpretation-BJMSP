Data archive for the paper: Circular Interpretation of projected normal regression coefficients

This repository contains all code and supplementary material for the paper:

Circular Interpretation of projected normal regression coefficients. 

The folder:
	-Manuscript includes the final manuscript and all figures used in the manuscript.
	 Note that not all figure code is contained here. For some figures code can be 
	 found in other folders.
	 
	-Mode Finding Algorithms contains code for finding the mode and HPD interval of
	 linear and circular variables.
	 
	-Paper 3 simulations contains code for all simulations, result files and plot output
	 for the simulation study.
	 
	-Pointing North Data contains the original data, instructions for data acces, code 
	 for transformation/simulation of the data used in the paper, code for analysis and code 
	 for figures and tables of the pointing north data.
	 
	-Regression Sampler contains the code for the MCMC sampler used to analyse a projected normal
	 regression model.
